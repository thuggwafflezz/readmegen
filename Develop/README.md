## Description
Technology used
1. javascript
2. node.js

## Purpose
This application takes user input and generates a "README.MD" file.
## Challenges 
One of the biggest challenges I faced was creating a diverging quetions branch on the user inputs. I eventually solved this issue by using the when operator built into inquirer. From there I was able to prompt for user input such as the description helper I'm using now, only when it was selected from the original user inputs. Other challenges included creating the functions to generate the sections that were included based on table of contents selection.
## Installation
    To install- Clone this repository.
## Usage
    To use this generator itself open the index.js file, using node, run 'node index.js'. It will intitialize the user promts section. To use the generator in it's entirety when prompted to use table of conents, select yes, and when promppted to use desciption helper select yes. Follow the prompts. The more thurough your response are the more thurough the generated readme will be. After all prompts are completed, a readme file will be generated that you can then copy and paste into your current project.
